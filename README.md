# Angular Course — Introduction

Welcome to the **Angular Course** repository — a beginner‑friendly, hands‑on path to learning Angular from the ground up.  
This README is intended to give instructors and students a concise orientation to the course: goals, prerequisites, structure, teaching approach, and how to use this repo.

## 🎯 Course Goal

By the end of this course students will be able to:

* Understand Angular architecture, components, modules, and services.
* Build real-world single‑page applications using Angular CLI, TypeScript.
* Implement routing, forms (template-driven & reactive), HTTP integration, and state management basics.
* Test components and services and follow Angular best practices.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Students should have:

* Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Familiarity with ES6+ JavaScript features (let/const, arrow functions, modules).
* Basic command-line usage and Git (recommended but not strictly required).

## 🧭 Course Structure (Overview)

The course is designed of instruction with a mix of lectures, live coding, and exercises.  
Each day focuses on a specific topic and builds on previous lessons. This repository contains:

* `course-docs` — contains lesson notes, code snippets and exercises for each topic

## 🧑‍🏫 Teaching Approach

* **Start simple:** Begin with Angular CLI and a minimal app to demonstrate component structure.
* **Incremental complexity:** Introduce features one at a time (components → templates → bindings → services → routing → forms → HTTP) with short demos and exercises.
* **Hands-on labs:** Each lesson includes a small lab or coding challenge for immediate practice.
* **Code reviews & pair programming:** Encourage students to submit PRs and review each other's code.
